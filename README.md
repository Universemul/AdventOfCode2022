## Before choosing your language

So we need to export your session ID :
```
export AOC_SESSION=my-id-session
```

We can find it with your browser inspector.

If you decide to do it with Python
----------

Go to the `python` folder.
```
python start.py
```

The script will download the current input.txt file and copy it into the good folder (e.g `day4`).  
it will add a `main.py` and `perf.py` to have a good start with the challenge of the day.


If you decide to do it with Rust
----------

Go to the `rust` folder.
```
python start.py
```

The script will download the current input.txt file and copy it into the good folder (e.g `day4`).  
it will add a `main.rs`, `lib.rs`, `util.rs` to have a good start with the challenge of the day.



HAVE FUN !
